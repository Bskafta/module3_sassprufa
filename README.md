# module3_sassprufa

Just trying out some stuff with SASS getting the feeling how it works. 
Playing with diffrent kind of buttons and styling them with scss. 
Creating Button.scss file to style the buttons. In styles.scss I use the @import function to call 
Button.scss which is compiled to a css. Helps keeping the files organized and styles.scss dosenÂ´t get really large.
